## Description
Welcome! My name is Michael Rath and this is my Eye Exercise that I completed as part of the MIT xPro coding course. This project is relatively simple and is an exercise in DOM elements and events. The eyes on the page simply follow the movement of the mouse around as long as the cursor is on the active part of the page.

## Technologies
Project is created with
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap v5.0

## Setup
To run and see this project, download locally, extract the files, and run the index.html file in your local browser.

## Roadmap
* In all honesty, there isn't much in the way of simple things I want to add to this project. In time I would like to apply the concepts for this project into my Pacman project, which can be located here https://github.com/rath-michael/mit-pacman-project
